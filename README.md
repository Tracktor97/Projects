# Security & Cryptography Projects

This repository contains a collection of small security-focused projects and research
exploring topics such as steganography, classical cryptography, and
binary data analysis. It also contains a few passion projects that I have
completed in my practicing of new libraries and features of python.

## Projects
- **Steganography (LSB Validation)**  
  Pre-validation tooling to determine carrier capacity for LSB
  steganographic embedding.

- **Rotation Cipher Analysis**  
  A Python tool for analyzing and breaking ROT/shift ciphers using
  frequency analysis and heuristic scoring.

  ## Research
  -**Mechanical Tolerance Analysis of a Consumer Combination Lock**
