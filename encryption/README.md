# Rotation Cipher Analysis Tool

This project implements a rotation (ROT) cipher analysis tool using
frequency analysis, heuristic scoring, and brute-force fallback.

## Features
- Letter frequency analysis based on English distributions
- Heuristic scoring for English legibility
- Verbose analysis mode
- Brute-force fallback for ambiguous cases

## Purpose
This project was built to explore classical cryptanalysis techniques and
to better understand how statistical properties of language can be used
to break simple substitution ciphers.

## Limitations
- Rotation ciphers are cryptographically insecure
- This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only
