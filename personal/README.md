# Date Machine Tool

This project implements a random selection of date ideas using 
random number generation. 

## Features
- Random number generation for rarity selection
- Repeatable functionality with non-repeatable log implementation
- Excel sheet analysis using pandas
- Customization options for modifiers

## Purpose
This project was built to satisfy a need for date-night activity
selection after my wife expressed a desire to have date night on
saturdays. I wanted to develop a tool that I could use to choose
and activity to complete with my wife on date night that included
fun challenges and extras. 

## Limitations
- The main limitation of this tool is your imagination, it will implement any and all ideas or modifiers you have
